Hanlin’s research focuses on several aspects of percolation on networks and other structures with higher-order interactions, such as simplicial complexes and hypergraphs. His current Ph.D. project aims to understand the percolation processes on higher-order structures and how the degree correlation can impact the critical behavior. He is also interested in the role of underlying network geometries in the critical behavior of percolation.

Before joining Queen Mary, Hanlin studied physics at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China.
